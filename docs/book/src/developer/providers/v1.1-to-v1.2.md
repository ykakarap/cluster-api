## Changes by Kind

### Deprecation

* `util.MachinesByCreationTimestamp` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

### Removals
* The `third_party/kubernetes-drain` package has been removed, as we're now using `k8s.io/kubectl/pkg/drain` instead ([PR](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/5440)). 
* `util/version.CompareWithBuildIdentifiers` has been removed, please use `util/version.Compare(a, b, WithBuildTags())` instead.
* The functions `annotations.HasPausedAnnotation` and `annotations.HasSkipRemediationAnnotation` have been removed, please use
  `annotations.HasPaused` and `annotations.HasSkipRemediation` respectively instead.

### API Changes

- `util.ClusterToInfrastructureMapFuncWithExternallyManagedCheck` was removed and the externally managed check was added to `util.ClusterToInfrastructureMapFunc`, which required changing its signature.
   Users of the former simply need to start using the latter and users of the latter need to add the new arguments to their call.
